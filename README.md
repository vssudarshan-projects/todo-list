# todo-list

A web program to organise your to do lists. You can perform the following operations:
1. Add items to a list
2. Check mark the items
3. Delete the items
4. Add, delete and rename different lists

The website uses,
1. Bootstrap for the layouts, jQuery for handling the scripting and AJAX for the https requests in the front end
2. The back end uses Nodejs and expressjs to handle https requests and routing. 
3. EJS is used as a templating engine.
4. I have implemented a LinkedList and a Splay Tree to store the list items and lists respectively.
5. Cookies are used to manage the session. Though, they will reset after 24 hours of first launching th website.
